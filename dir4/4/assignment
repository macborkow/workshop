In this assignment we're going to create a bash script that serves the role of a linter.

1. We want it to replace variable number of spaces into a single tab using command parameter -s.
2. Any whitespace at the end of each line should be removed.
3. Multiple empty lines should collapse into a single empty line.
4. Strings surrounded by double quotes ie ("$string") should be replaced by single quotes ('$string').
5. Change kebab-case variables into camelCase for variables and PascalCase for function names.
6. Linter should give you a warning when it spots reserver word 'var' and inform you on which line and at which character it is placed.
